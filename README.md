# Optools :hammer_and_wrench:
Optools is a toolset intended to aid tinkering with Toontown Rewritten's custom bytecode format.
Side note, the decrypter only takes proprietary keys.

## Notes
- By the time this repository, this is probably outdated? It shouldn't be too hard to fix with a little bit of knowledge on reverse engineering.

## Features
- Code decryption
- Diffing?

## Requirements
- `colorama`
- `my dumper?`

## Roadmap
- Full decompiler?
