# Optools :hammer_and_wrench:
Optools is a toolset intended to aid tinkering with Toontown Rewritten's custom bytecode format.
Side note, the decryptor only takes proprietary keys.

## Features
- Code decryption
- Diffing?

## Requirements
- `colorama`
- `my dumper?`

## Decryptor
Due to this project being a work-in-progress, the decryptor actually only half works. Toontown Rewritten's bytecode encryption is a massive pain to fully decrypt.
